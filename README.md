# Making Embedded Systems
This is a companion repository for _Making Embedded Systems, 2nd Ed._ by Elecia White. 

Interested in developing embedded systems? Since they don't tolerate inefficiency, these systems require a disciplined approach to programming. This easy-to-read guide helps you cultivate good development practices based on classic software design patterns and new patterns unique to embedded programming. You'll learn how to build system architecture for processors, not operating systems, and discover techniques for dealing with hardware difficulties, changing designs, and manufacturing requirements.

Written by Elecia White, an expert who's created embedded systems ranging from DNA scanners to children's toys, this book is ideal for intermediate and experienced programmers, no matter what platform you use. This expanded update includes new chapters on IoT and networked sensors, motors and movement, and data handling strategies.

Optimize your system to reduce cost and increase performance
 * Develop an architecture that makes your software robust in resource-constrained environments
 * Explore sensors, displays, motors, and other I/O devices
 * Reduce RAM and power consumption, code space, and processor cycles
 * Learn how to interpret schematics, datasheets, and power requirements
 * Discover how to implement complex mathematics and machine learning on small processors
 * Design effective embedded systems for IoT and networked sensors

# This Repository
This repository is a companion to the book. While there is code in this repository, there are other resources that are critical so expect to see lots of links and some spreadsheets. 

# Some Links
[Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) simulates processors in embedded systems, giving you board level control. If you aren't ready to buy a dev board, look here. Some of my sample code will be for Wokwi for use with the [ST Nucleo L031K6](https://wokwi.com/projects/new/st-nucleo-l031k6) and [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://wokwi.com/projects/new/pi-pico-w-sdk). Note that the Wokwi landing site shows all kinds of languages including Processing (Arduino), Rust, and MicroPython. You may have to dig for the C++ interfaces.


Here are some of my current favorite blogs:  
  * The [Embedded Artistry Blog and Site](https://embeddedartistry.com/first-time-here/) has a wealth of information about design, implementation, and planning. While there are pay-for classes, a great deal of the information is free. One of my favorites here is where [the author looks at old games to get practice reading code](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2019/05/06/programmers-lets-study-source-code-classics/).
  
  * [Memfaultâ€™s Interrupt Blog](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/) is a useful source of information about IoT and Cortex processors. Memfault also has a lively Slack channel, check their website for a link.
  
  * [Miro Samek's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/StateMachineCOM) shows Miro coding systems. He focuses a lot on state machines, you can find more no his Quantum Leaps site at [state-machine.com](https://www.state-machine.com/). 
  
  * The [Embedded Software Engineering 101](https://embedded.fm/blog/ese101) blog series by Chris Svec shows getting started from a lower level system using an MSP430.

Here are some C++ learning resources:
  * [C++ Weekly with Jason Turner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHAlbZQNFU2LgEtiqd2Maw) is a video series taught by someone who really knows C++ and loves to share it.
  
  * [Learncpp.com](http://Learncpp.com) is a free website teaching C++ programming.

  * [C++ on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/cpp/exercises) provides exercises you can use to practice C++.

Finally, if you are looking for inspiration or a place to post your projects, [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/) and [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/) are sites where you can post your project, get comments, and enter contests (for hardware or cash).
