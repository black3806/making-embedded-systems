# Chapter 7: Communicating with Peripherals
This is a companion repository for _Making Embedded Systems, 2nd Ed._ by Elecia White. 

Following Along:
 * OSI model of communication protocols on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
 * Calculations related to the SPI comparison in the chapter are in [SPI_clock_calculations.xlsx](SPI_clock_calculations.xlsx)
 * For an example implementation of FIFO versus DMA, look for [James Lynch’s write-up on Atmel’s AT91SAM7 serial communications](at91sam7_serial_communications.pdf). 
 * Embedded Artistry has an excellent and lengthy [blog post about circular buffers](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/05/17/creating-a-circular-buffer-in-c-and-c/) that includes a github repository of [working code in C](https://github.com/embeddedartistry/embedded-resources/tree/master/examples/c) and [C++](https://github.com/embeddedartistry/embedded-resources/tree/master/examples/cpp).
