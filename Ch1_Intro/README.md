This is a companion repository for _Making Embedded Systems, 2nd Ed._ by Elecia White. 



Want to know what happens before main? The [True Story of Hello World](https://www.lisha.ufsc.br/teaching/os/exercise/hello.html) is a blog post that talks about going from code through compiling and linking, then into loading and running. It is linux based but the steps are very relevant to embedded systems. For something more hardware and embedded centric this video about the [Cortex-M boot process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brOzLJmeek) is very good.
