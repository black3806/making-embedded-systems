# Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands on Hardware
This is a companion repository for _Making Embedded Systems, 2nd Ed._ by Elecia White. 


# Following Along in the Book
In order of when they appear in the book:
 * Example Schematic FIXME
 * Slides that show the progression from [Arduino Block Diagram to Schematic to Board](ArduinoBlockDiagramToSchematics.pdf) 
 * [Ardunio Schematic](UNO-TH_Rev3e_sch.pdf) on its own was obtained from [Arduino](https://content.arduino.cc/assets/UNO-TH_Rev3e_sch.pdf)
 * [ATmega328 Datasheet](ATmega48A-PA-88A-PA-168A-PA-328-P-DS-DS40002061B.pdf) (obtained from [Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATmega328#document-table))
  * Command and Response Example (FIXME folder) and on [Wokwi with the Raspberry Pi Pico C SDK](https://wokwi.com/projects/324879108372693587).


# Digging Deeper into Electronics
EE Basics:
 * Make: Electronics by Charles Platt is a good getting-started-with electronics book. 
 * Forest Mims books are classic, they tend to have a solution for a given problem
 * [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) : a series of lectures and projects about how to go from logic gates to software (there is a book that is part of this as well: The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Compiplesuter from First Principals )
 * [Free textbook for Electrical Engineering & Electronics](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/)
 * [Combinational Logic Circuits using Logic Gates](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_1.html)
 * Games:
    * [Turing Complete](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/) - logic and processor design, hidden inside a game
    * Zachtronics’ [TIS-100](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/) - logic and processor design, hidden inside a game
    * Zachtronics’ [Shenzhen IO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/) - circuit level design hidden inside a game
    * [Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine) by Tomorrow Corporation - assembly programming, in a game
  * For learning to make boards, try out Getting to Blinky by [Contextual Electronics](https://contextualelectronics.com/), a good place for how-to electronics education

# Code For This Chapter
  * Command and Response Example (FIXME folder) and on [Wokwi with the Raspberry Pi Pico C SDK](https://wokwi.com/projects/324879108372693587).

FIXME
Not implemented. Planning to have examples for:
  * Flash test
  * Error handling


The [ARM GNU toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) is very popular and can be run under Visual Studio Code. It may also be run underneath some other IDEs.
