# Chapter 2: Creating a System Architecture
This is a companion repository for _Making Embedded Systems, 2nd Ed._ by Elecia White. 

Some tools for creating system and block diagrams: 
 * My favorite is Mermaid Markdown which can be created with text and used in Readme.md files. You can use it live: [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/) 
 * [draw.io] (https://app.diagrams.net/) makes online flowcharts and diagrams ([its code](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/tag/v15.8.7)), no signup
 * [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) is also very popular
