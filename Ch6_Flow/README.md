# Chapter 6: Managing the Flow of Control
This is a companion repository for _Making Embedded Systems, 2nd Ed._ by Elecia White. 

# Following Along in the Book
The [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) is a fantastic resource for learning about operating systems. It is a little easier to start with a question and dig in than to wander that site.  

[Designing Reusable Classes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215446177_Designing_Reusable_Classes) by Ralph Johnson and Brian Foote is a paper from 1988 that is still one of the best references for how to design reusable code (and why).

Miro Samek of Quantum Leaps is an enthusiastic advocate for the active object pattern and good software in embedded systems. His [books and blog](https://www.state-machine.com/kb) are filled with excellent information but his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMGXFEew8I6gzjg3tWen4Gw) are particularly instructive as he codes the systems as he talks.


Watchdog
 * [Proper Watchdog Timer Use](https://betterembsw.blogspot.com/2014/05/proper-watchdog-timer-use.html) a blog post by Phil Koopman
 * A comparison of [Internal vs External Watchdog Timers](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/4/4229.html) an article by Analog Devices

Timers
 * [Controlling STM32 Hardware Timers using HAL](https://visualgdb.com/tutorials/arm/stm32/timers/hal/), a VisualGDB Tutorials
 * An [ST Presentation on Timers](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/training/technical/product_training/group0/2d/93/74/3f/33/83/47/95/STM32F7_WDG_TIMERS_GPTIM/files/STM32F7_WDG_TIMERS_GPTIM.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.STM32F7_WDG_TIMERS_GPTIM.pdf)

 PWM
 The RPi Picoâ€™s processor is the RP2040. The RP2040 has an [extraordinarily datasheet / good user manual](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf). The PWM section is particularly good.
