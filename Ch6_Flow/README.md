 * Processor documents
   * [ATtiny AVR Microcontroller Datasheet](../Ch4_IOTimers/Atmel-2586-AVR-8-bit-Microcontroller-ATtiny25-ATtiny45-ATtiny85_Datasheet.pdf)
   * [TI MSP430x2xx User's Guide](../Ch4_IOTimers/TI_MSP430x2xx_Users_Guide_slau144k.pdf)
   * [STM32F103 Reference Manual](../Ch4_IOTimers/stmicroelectrics-stm32f101xx-stm32f102xx-stm32f103xx-stm32f105xx-and-stm32f107xx-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus.pdf) and [github repository](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32Cube_MCU_Overall_Offer), specifically [stm32f103x6.h](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis_device_f1/blob/master/Include/stm32f103x6.h)


* [Designing Reusable Classes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215446177_Designing_Reusable_Classes) by Ralph Johnson and Brian Foote.
* Miro Samek of Quantum Leaps is an enthusiastic advocate for the active object pattern and good software in embedded systems. His [books and blog](https://www.state-machine.com/kb) are filled with excellent information but his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMGXFEew8I6gzjg3tWen4Gw) are particularly instructive as he codes the systems as he talks.
* OSDev Wiki is a fantastic resource for learning about operating systems https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page
