# Chapter 10: IoT and Networked Sensors
This is a companion repository for _Making Embedded Systems, 2nd Ed._ by Elecia White. 

# Following Along in the Book
**Network systems** administration is tough, especially when it is a minor part of the system you are tasked to build. To get up to speed on how it all works, I like this [Overview of Networks](https://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current2/html/intro.html) which is the introduction of a much longer book. If you'd prefer videos, this [Networking Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIFyRwBY_4bRLmKfP1KnZA6rZbRHtxmXi) play list is a great place to get started.

As with networks, **BLE** has many books to help you get oriented. 
(FIXME: the page I was going to suggest is v. old)

Creating an **application level communication protocol** is something you'll probably have to do at some point. Check out Memfault's [Event Serialization](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/mcu/event-serialization-overview/) post on the pros and cons of different methods. Wikipedia has a broader [comparison of data serialization formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data-serialization_formats).

**Checksums** can identify errors in communication. While there are many simple checksums, CRCs are a better way to go. The Barr Group has a [deep dive into calculating CRCs](https://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/CRC-Calculation-C-Code) that includes code and examples. (The CRC series starts [here](https://barrgroup.com/tech-talks/checksums-and-crcs) if you want to see the whole derivation.)
