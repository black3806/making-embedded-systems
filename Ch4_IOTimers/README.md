 * [TI MSP430x2xx User's Guide](TI_MSP430x2xx_Users_Guide_slau144k.pdf)
 * [STM32F103 Reference Manual](stmicroelectrics-stm32f101xx-stm32f102xx-stm32f103xx-stm32f105xx-and-stm32f107xx-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus.pdf)


For understanding and practicing hex and bitwise operations:
  * [YouTube: Bit Hacks from Beginner to Advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRNO-ewsNcQ) is an excellent video
  * [calc.50x.ca](https://calc.50x.ca/) provide a hex calculator showing the binary values
  * [bitwiseCmd](https://bitwisecmd.com/) lets you try out bitwise operations
  * For more bit twiddling hacks and seeing how you can do optimal things (usually at the cost of readability), check out [Stanford Graphics Bithacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)
