This is a companion repository for _Making Embedded Systems, 2nd Ed._ by Elecia White.

[Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/fa08/papers/stack_smashing.pdf): buffer vulnerabilities and why stacks and heaps are important

# Other resource 
This chapter's interview question wasn't technical so if you are wishing for embedded questions to dig your teeth into:
 * [Top Embedded C Interview Questions (2022) - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/embedded-c-interview-questions/)
 * [A ‘C’ Test: The 0x10 Best Questions for Would-be Embedded Programmers | RMB Consulting](https://rmbconsulting.us/publications/a-c-test-the-0x10-best-questions-for-would-be-embedded-programmers/)

[Chris Svec's Embedded Software Engineering 101](https://embedded.fm/blog/ese101) blog series is quite good. In particular, he has some about interrupts that are at a very low level: [1](https://embedded.fm/blog/ese101-interrupts-and-cows), [2](https://embedded.fm/blog/ese101-msp430-interrupts), [3](https://embedded.fm/blog/ese101-interrupts-blink)
